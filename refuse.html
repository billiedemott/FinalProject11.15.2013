                    <p class= "first-copy-bit">Take a scroll through my life. Scroll</p>

                    <p class="second-copy-bit">My life path has felt a little like the movement of this copy: seemingly all over the place, but pieced together has hidden direction.<span>Scroll</span></p>

                    <p class = "third-copy-bit">I graduated Amherst with <a href="# writing">a piece of writing</a> I loved and the hope I'd copywrite ads in the City. My way in was as a PA in Broadcast Production at <a href="http://www.jwt.com"> JWT</a> Scroll.</p>

                    <p class="fourth-copy-bit">A year as a PA landed me thinking I wanted to go law school. I ended up at a hedge fund to make this transition I realized I shouldn't. Quickly, I figured out this was a <span class="italicized text">dayjob</span> and my side projects [supported by this job] were what would make <span class="italicized text">my day</span>. Scroll </p> 

                    <p class="fifth-copy-bit">First taste of the startup world helping get press for my friend's mobile game, TapFarm. This game evolved into Pocket Gems, a company with 15+ leading titles and 150+ employees. This experience was a view into the gratification of entrepreneurship.
